# gulp nujucks - WIP

a starter for projects that needs static html files.

## What's here
- nunjucks for templating HTML
- sass/scss compilation with autoprefixing
- hot reload server using browsersync
- ES6 transpilation using babel

## what's not yet here
- sourcemap
- asset compilation
- asset minification
- scripts minification
- better README instructions

## usage
install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
do `gulp --tasks` to list all the available tasks

## why?
- there are a couple of stuffs that need this kind of setup
- might as well try gulp4
- might as well experiment with webpack
- a rabbit hole around automation and toolings is quite interesting and fun to jump into
